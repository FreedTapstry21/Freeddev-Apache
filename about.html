                         Hey there, I am Freed. <br>
                         I'm a 15 year old bisexual human who loves technology. <br>
                         I do a lot with programming and tinkering with software and electronics. <br>
                         <br>
                         I do know some of the programming languages out there, like: Python and a bit of Javascript.<br>
                         And I mean, HTML and CSS aren't really programming languages, but I do know those as well. <br>
                         There are also some programming languages which I am still in the process of learning like Rust and C. <br>
                         <br>
                         Oh yeah and not to forget, I am obsessed with Linux and smaller electronics, like Raspberry Pi's or Arduino's. <br>
                         <br>
                         You can always check out some of my projects at <a href="https://github.com/FreedTapstry21">GitHub</a>.

                    <h3>2019</h3>
                    <p>
                         The year of portable operating systems. <br>
                         I started tinkering with different operating systems. <br>
                         Especially Windows and FreeDOS. <br>
                         Back then I also discovered on how to boot Windows or FreeDOS from a USB drive. <br>
                         I also had my first encounter with Linux on my first Raspberry Pi. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2020</h3>
                    <p>
                         The year of ...being home? <br>
                         In this year I started making a lot of Minecraft servers.  <br>
                         Thanks to this I learned about port forwarding and a bit about infrastructure. <br>
                         I also bought my first Arduino in this year, which I liked to tinker with. <br>
                         And not to forget, I tried to make this exact website, which back then failed. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2021</h3>
                    <p>
                         The year of Raspberry Pi. <br>
                         In January 2021 I kinda destroyed my previous Raspberry Pi so I bought a new one. <br>
                         I used this Raspberry pi as my server. And it's still online untill this day. <br>
                         I also did a lot of small little Arduino projects in this year. <br>
                         For example, I made a GUI for my Arduino with a mouse cursor and all. <br>
                         Sadly, I never really used it in any kind of larger project. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2022</h3>
                    <p>
                         The year of Linux. <br>
                         Around October 2021 I tried to install Zorin OS onto an external drive with no success. <br>
                         So January 2022 I tried again, and it worked. <br>
                         I started with Zorin OS and then started distro hopping. <br>
                         Eventually in June 2022 I stopped at Arch Linux where I'm still at to this day. <br>
                         I also setup 2 more servers.  <br>
                         A Raspberry Pi 400, which I use for my VPN and personal Minecraft server. <br>
                         And an old Acer Aspire 8943G, which I use for almost everything server related. <br>
                    </p>
